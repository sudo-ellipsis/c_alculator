# C_alculator - An unfinished C calculator

A simple C calculator I made for fun using the shunting yard algorithm to generate and evaluate reverse polish notation from a tokenised input.
Supports a variety of functions and operators.

The power symbol `^` is considered to be right associative, such as in python, and unlike C.

## Build Instructions
```
make
make clean
./calc
